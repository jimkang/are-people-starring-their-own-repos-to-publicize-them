# are-people-starring-their-own-repos-to-publicize-them

Are people publicize their own repos to publicize them via GitHub home feeds?

I don't think there's anything wrong with that! You gotta get the word out. But I'm wondering if this is indeed why people star their own repos or if it's something else. Feel free to open an issue to let me know!
